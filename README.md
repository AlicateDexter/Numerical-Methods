# Numerical-Methods

As Mechanical Engineer Bachaleor, a starting point for me to learn a new language always comes from how this language can help me to solve engineering problems. Generally, it's from a numerical method. Being simple and self contained projects, numerical methods are a efficient way to understand the nuances and singularities of a particular language for scientific computation.

In this Repository, Numerical Methods are implemented in the following languages: <br> 

<span>&#8226;</span> Python; <br>
<span>&#8226;</span> Octave; <br>
<span>&#8226;</span> VBA (to be developed); <br>
<span>&#8226;</span> Julia (to be developed);
